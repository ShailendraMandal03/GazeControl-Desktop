# GazeControl-Desktop
👁️ Gaze-Based Interaction and Visualization using Tobii Eye Tracker 5 and Tobii Ghost 
This project uses Tobii Eye Tracker 5 along with Tobii Ghost (for green bubble overlay visualization) to detect and interact with desktop elements using eye gaze. The system tracks eye movements, identifies fixations and saccades, and triggers clicks (single/double) based on gaze hold. A green circle (from Tobii Ghost) is used as the visual indicator of the user’s gaze point.
 ** 📌 Features**
    •	Tracks real-time gaze using a green bubble overlay.
    •	Clicks on desktop icons or items by holding gaze.
    •	Double-click support to open files/folders.
    •	Detects fixations and saccades.
    •	Visualizes gaze path (scanpath) with matplotlib.
    •	Non-intrusive – clicks without moving mouse cursor.

🔧** Hardware and Software Requirements**
💠 **Hardware**
        •	Tobii Eye Tracker 5
        •	A monitor with Tobii Eye Tracker 5 attached and calibrated.
        •	Windows PC with admin rights.
📍 Software
    •	Tobii Ghost (for visualizing gaze as a green bubble)
    o	Install from: https://gaming.tobii.com/software/ghost/
    o	Use for visual overlay — enables detection through computer vision.
________________________________________
🐍 **Python Environment Setup
🧰 Required Python Packages**
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then install the following dependencies:
pip install pyautogui keyboard opencv-python numpy pywinauto matplotlib
⚠️ Additional Notes:
•	Tkinter may be preinstalled with Python, or can be installed via system package manager if needed.
•	Admin permissions might be required for pywinauto.mouse to work properly.

▶️ Running the Program
🪟 Before You Start
1.	Connect and calibrate Tobii Eye Tracker 5 using Tobii Experience.
2.	Launch Tobii Ghost:
o	Enable the green bubble overlay (usually a green circle showing gaze).
o	Ensure it is visible on your screen.
🏋️ Start the Script
Run the main script from terminal or your IDE:
python gaze_click_tracker.py
🎯 Interacting with the System
•	Hold gaze on a desktop icon or item:
o	≥ 0.5 seconds = Single click.
o	≥ 0.6 seconds on desktop = Double click (e.g., open folder).
•	Fixation is detected when gaze stays within a 25-pixel radius.
•	Saccade is detected when gaze speed exceeds 1300 px/sec.
•	Exit by pressing the q key.
________________________________________
**📊 Output & Visualization**
At the end of a session:
  •	Gaze data is stored in a list (gaze_log) and printed.
  •	Fixation and saccade details are tracked with time and position.
  •	You can optionally enable plot_scanpath(...) to visualize gaze behavior:
  # Uncomment in finally block
  plot_scanpath(gaze_log, fixations, saccades)
  This will plot:
  •	Gaze path (dotted line)
  •	Fixation points (red dots)
  •	Saccades (blue arrows)

🔍 **Key Parameters and Thresholds**
Parameter	Description	Value
GAZE_HOLD_TIME	Time to trigger single click	0.5 sec
DOUBLE_CLICK_HOLD_TIME	Time to trigger double click	0.6 sec
SACCADE_VELOCITY_THRESHOLD	Minimum speed to qualify as saccade	1300 px/sec
GAZE_HOLD_RADIUS	Pixel radius for fixation	25 px
CLICK_COOLDOWN	Time before next click allowed	3 sec
HSV_LOWER/UPPER	HSV range for green detection	[55, 180, 180] to [70, 255, 255]
________________________________________
🧐** How It Works (Behind the Scenes)**
1.	Tobii Ghost overlays a green bubble indicating gaze position.
2.	The Python script captures screen frames using pyautogui.screenshot().
3.	Applies HSV masking to detect the green circle.
4.	Calculates:
o	Gaze position in screen coordinates.
o	Speed between gaze points to detect saccades.
o	If gaze is held still long enough — triggers click events.
5.	Logs all gaze activity, fixations, and saccades.

**✅ Tips for Best Accuracy**
•	Calibrate Tobii Eye Tracker using official Tobii Experience app.
•	Use a non-glossy monitor to reduce reflection noise.
•	Sit at a consistent distance and posture from the screen.
•	Use under consistent lighting conditions.
________________________________________
🧪** Future Ideas**
•	Save gaze logs to CSV/JSON for post-analysis.
•	Integrate with actual Tobii SDK for more precise data (if available).
•	Real-time content-aware click targeting.
•	Extend to web-based interaction or app controls.
